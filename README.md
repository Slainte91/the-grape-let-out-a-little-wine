Using the Red Wine Quality Dataset from kaggle, the purpose of this project is to analyze the dataset and determine what factors affect the quality of red variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. Using Machine Learning processes including Regression, decision trees, clustering and prediction analysis we endeavor to use the data to build an algorithm that accurately predicts quality/wine ratings based on different variables relating to individual wine characteristics ranging from cultivation to retail distribution.
